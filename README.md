[![](https://vueschool.io/media/e256afbe4cfb56f8e3df32d2550d6823/vueschool_vue-apollo-graphql-fundamentals-course.jpg)](https://vueschool.io/courses/whats-new-in-vue-3)

This repository contains the example code for the [Vue-Apollo GraphQL Fundamentals](https://vueschool.io/courses/vue-apollo-graphql-fundamentals) course.

In this course, you'll learn how to use Vue-Apollo and GraphQL APIs in your Vue.js applications.

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime to execute said queries. The Apollo client is a complete state management library that takes care of caching data, refetching queries, and much more.

Vue Apollo and GraphQL allow us to build robust and performant user interfaces efficiently.

During the course, we'll be working with the SpaceX GraphQL API. You'll learn best practices and workflow tips that enhance productivity and improves the developer experience.


This course assumes that you know the fundamentals of GraphQL. If you do not, we recommend that you take our [GraphQL Fundamentals course](https://vueschool.io/courses/learn-graphql-fundamentals) beforehand.
